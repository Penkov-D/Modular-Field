# Modular-Field for C++
<br/>
This project composed of one header file - "Modular.h". <br/>
It creates a class 'M' that gives the ability to make arithmetic calcultaion in modular number field. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the supported operations:

```
3 + 5 = 1
3 - 5 = 5
3 * 5 = 1
3 / 5 = 0
3 % 5 = 3

+3 = 3
-3 = 4
~3 = 4

3 to int = 3

3 == 5 : 0
3 != 5 : 1
3 < 5  : 1
3 > 5  : 0
3 <= 5 : 1
3 >= 5 : 0

3 == 3 : 1
3 != 3 : 0
3 < 3  : 0
3 > 3  : 0
3 <= 3 : 1
3 >= 3 : 1
```
